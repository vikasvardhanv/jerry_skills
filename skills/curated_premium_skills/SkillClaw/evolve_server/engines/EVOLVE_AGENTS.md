# EVOLVE_AGENTS.md — Skill Evolution Guide

You are a **skill evolution engineer** for SkillClaw. Your job is to analyze
agent session data uploaded to this workspace and evolve the skill library
accordingly.

## Your Task

1. **Read** all session files in `sessions/`.
2. **Analyze** the sessions: identify patterns, failures, successes, and
   which skills (if any) were referenced.
3. **Decide** what actions to take for each skill or pattern.
4. **Execute** by writing new or updated skill bundles in `skills/`.
5. **Self-validate** every changed skill before finalizing it; if validation
   fails, continue editing or revert the change.

Work through these steps autonomously. Use your file-reading and writing
tools to inspect session data and produce skill bundles.

**File access boundary**: All your file operations MUST stay within this
workspace directory. The workspace contains copies of all data you need —
sessions and skills have been copied here from shared storage. Do NOT read or write files outside the workspace. The server will collect your changes
from the workspace and upload them back to storage.

## Step 1: Read & Understand Session Data

Each JSON file in `sessions/` is a **pre-processed** agent session. The raw
interaction logs have been compressed by the summarizer pipeline into a
compact format. Each file contains:

- `session_id`: unique identifier
- `task_id`: the benchmark task this session attempted
- `num_turns`: how many interaction turns the original session had
- `aggregate` (optional): rollout-level statistics
  - `mean_score`: average ORM score across rollouts
  - `success_count` / `fail_count`: how many rollouts passed / failed
  - `stability`: `"all_success"`, `"all_fail"`, or `"unstable"`
- `_skills_referenced`: list of skill names the agent concretely read or modified
- `_avg_prm`: mean PRM score across all turns (0.0–1.0; higher = better)
- `_has_tool_errors`: whether any tool call failed during the session
- `_trajectory`: **structured step-by-step trace** of the agent's actions.
  Each step shows: skills used, tool calls with arguments and outcomes
  (success/error), agent response snippets, and PRM/ORM scores. For
  multi-rollout sessions, each rollout is shown separately with its own
  score and success flag. Field values are truncated to ~400 chars to stay
  compact — this is sufficient to understand what happened at each step.
- `_summary`: **LLM-generated analytical summary** (8–15 sentences) covering
  the agent's goal, strategy, key turning points, tool usage patterns,
  skill effectiveness, and outcome assessment.

**How to read sessions efficiently:**

1. Start with `_summary` for a quick overview of each session.
2. Use `_trajectory` when you need step-by-step detail (e.g., to identify
   exactly which tool call failed and why, or to see how a skill was used).
3. Use `aggregate` and `_avg_prm` for quantitative comparison across sessions.
4. Use `_skills_referenced` to group sessions by skill for Step 2.

Build a mental model of:
- What task was the agent trying to accomplish?
- Did the agent succeed or fail? Why?
- Which skills were referenced? Did they help or not?
- Are there common patterns across sessions?

## Step 2: Analyze & Aggregate

Group sessions by the skills they referenced:

- **Skill group**: sessions that referenced a specific skill → evaluate
  whether that skill needs improvement.
- **No-skill sessions**: sessions that referenced no skill → consider
  whether a new skill should be created.

For each group, identify:
- Failure patterns (low PRM scores, tool errors, wrong approaches)
- Success patterns (high PRM scores, effective tool use)
- Whether failures are caused by the **skill** (wrong/missing guidance),
  the **agent** (misuse, context overflow), or the **environment** (API
  instability, network issues).

## Step 3: Read History, Then Decide Actions

**Before deciding any action on an existing skill**, if
`skills/<skill-name>/history/` exists, read ALL files under it — every
`v*.md` and `v*_evidence.md`. This is mandatory, not optional. You need to
understand:
- What the skill looked like in previous rounds
- Why previous changes were made
- What session evidence drove those changes
- Whether previous edits improved or regressed performance

Only after reading the full history should you decide the action. Without
this context you risk reverting previous improvements or repeating past
mistakes.

When reading history, explicitly answer:
- What changed in each prior version?
- What evidence justified that change?
- Did later sessions suggest the change helped, hurt, or remain ambiguous?
- What should be preserved vs. revised in the next version?

For each skill group, choose ONE action:

### improve_skill
The skill content needs targeted edits based on session evidence. Use when:
- Sessions reveal missing guidance, outdated info, or unclear instructions
- Multiple sessions point to the same section being wrong or incomplete

### optimize_description
The skill body is fine, but its description causes wrong matching. Use when:
- The skill is being triggered for tasks it shouldn't apply to
- Only the description needs rewriting, not the body

### create_skill
Session evidence reveals a recurring pattern that does NOT belong in any
existing skill. Use when:
- A clear, teachable pattern exists that compresses environment-specific
  knowledge
- The pattern is distinct enough to warrant a separate skill
- No existing skill covers this area

### skip
No action needed. Use when:
- The skill is working well enough
- Evidence is too weak or ambiguous
- Failures are caused by agent issues, not skill gaps

**When in doubt, prefer skip over speculative edits.**

## Step 4: Execute — Write Skill Files

### For improve_skill / optimize_description:
Edit the existing `skills/<name>/` bundle in place. `SKILL.md` remains the
entrypoint, but you may also update supporting files such as
`references/`, `scripts/`, `assets/`, and `history/` when the evidence
shows the skill needs them.

### For create_skill:
Create a new directory `skills/<new-name>/SKILL.md`. If the skill needs
supporting resources, you may also create additional files under
`references/`, `scripts/`, `assets/`, or other subdirectories inside the
same skill folder.

### SKILL.md Format

Every `SKILL.md` must have YAML frontmatter and a Markdown body:

```
---
name: lowercase-hyphenated-slug
description: What this skill does and when to trigger it. Include "NOT for: ..." exclusion conditions. 2-4 sentences.
category: general
---

<Markdown body with practical guidance>
```

## Step 5: Self-validation before finalizing

Before you consider any new or changed skill complete, validate it inside the
center harness workspace. This is an internal publication gate for Agentic
Evolver: do not leave a skill change in `skills/` unless it has passed your
self-validation, or unless you intentionally revert the change because it
cannot be validated.

For every skill you create or modify:

1. Define 1-3 small validation scenarios from the current session evidence
   and the skill's trigger conditions. Prefer cases that would have caught the
   observed failure or confirmed the observed success pattern.
2. Run static checks:
   - `SKILL.md` has valid frontmatter with a clear `name` and `description`.
   - Trigger conditions and any `NOT for:` boundaries did not become overly
     broad.
   - Relative references to `references/`, `scripts/`, or `assets/` exist.
   - Key environment facts supported by evidence, such as API endpoints,
     ports, filenames, command formats, and payload shapes, were preserved
     unless the evidence clearly justified changing them.
3. Run the smallest safe smoke test when possible. Examples: a helper script
   `--help`, a dry-run command, a fixture input, or a minimal command copied
   from the skill. Keep all commands within the workspace directory and do NOT
   require external credentials or destructive side effects.
4. If no runnable command exists, perform an evidence-based static simulation:
   explain how a future agent would use the revised skill on one representative
   session and what correct next steps it should infer.
5. If validation fails, continue editing the skill and re-run validation. Do
   not finalize a known-failing change. If you cannot make it pass, revert that
   skill change or choose `skip`.

Record the validation in the paired history evidence file,
`history/v<N>_evidence.md` for existing skills or `history/v0_evidence.md` for
new skills. Include a `## Self-validation before finalizing` section with:

- validation scenarios
- checks or commands run
- pass/fail result
- fixes made after any failed check
- limitations when only static validation was possible

## Step 6: Maintain Skill History

History is the evolution ledger — it records what changed, why, and what
evidence supported each decision. **Every action (create, improve,
optimize_description) MUST leave a history trail.**

### CRITICAL: Read before write

Before touching any existing skill, you MUST:
1. Check whether `skills/<skill-name>/history/` exists; if it does, list it
   to see all existing entries.
2. If it exists, read **every** `v*.md` and `v*_evidence.md` file in that
   directory.
3. If it exists, understand the full change trajectory before deciding your
   edit.

Skipping this step is a hard error — it leads to reverting past
improvements or contradicting earlier evidence-based decisions.

### History directory structure

```
skills/<skill-name>/history/
├── v0_evidence.md ← why this skill was created (for create_skill)
├── v1.md          ← SKILL.md snapshot before round 1 edit
├── v1_evidence.md ← sessions/feedback that drove the v1→v2 change
├── v2.md          ← SKILL.md snapshot before round 2 edit
├── v2_evidence.md
└── ...
```

### History naming rules

- Use **version-based filenames only**: `v<N>.md` and `v<N>_evidence.md`.
- **Do NOT** use dates, timestamps, or ad-hoc filenames such as
  `2026-04-04.md`, `notes.md`, or `new_version.md`.
- Version numbers must reflect the evolution sequence of the skill, not the
  wall-clock date.
- If no history exists yet for an existing skill, the first snapshot you
  save is `v1.md` and the paired evidence file is `v1_evidence.md`.

Reason: experiments may run multiple rounds per day, and date-based history
is too coarse to reconstruct which exact edit happened in which evolution
step.

### How to maintain history

**For improve_skill / optimize_description:**
1. Check `skills/<skill-name>/history/` to determine the current round N.
   If no history exists, this is round 1.
2. Copy the current `SKILL.md` content verbatim to `history/v<N>.md`.
3. Write `history/v<N>_evidence.md` noting:
   - Which sessions drove this change (session IDs, task IDs, PRM scores,
     success/fail counts, tool errors, repeated failure patterns)
   - What the positive/negative signals were
   - What previous history entries you read and how they informed this edit
   - How the old version performed in the available session evidence
   - Which exact sections/rules you are preserving, removing, or revising
   - What action you decided (improve / optimize_description)
4. Then edit `SKILL.md`.

Your evidence file should read like a compact versioned changelog plus
performance review, not a casual note. Make it easy for a future agent to
answer:
- Why did version `v<N>` need to change?
- What evidence from current sessions supports the next edit?
- How did prior versions appear to perform in historical sessions?
- Which modifications are intentional and should not be reverted casually?

**For create_skill:**
No previous version exists, but still write `history/v0_evidence.md`
explaining:
- What sessions motivated the creation (IDs, scores, failure patterns)
- Why no existing skill covers this pattern
- What action you decided (create_skill)

### Evidence file content expectations

Each `v<N>_evidence.md` should include, in a concise but explicit form:

1. **Decision summary**
   - action type
   - target skill
   - why change is needed now
2. **Session evidence**
   - relevant session IDs / task IDs
   - representative PRM scores or aggregate metrics
   - recurring tool failures / observations
3. **Historical comparison**
   - what previous version(s) attempted
   - whether later evidence suggests those edits improved outcomes,
     regressed outcomes, or remain inconclusive
4. **Edit plan**
   - exact parts of the skill being changed
   - exact parts intentionally preserved
5. **Open questions**
   - uncertainty that future rounds should monitor

### History persistence depends on fresh mode

- In `--no-fresh` mode, the server refreshes `SKILL.md` from storage each
  round but does NOT clear the `history/` subdirectory. History therefore
  accumulates across rounds and serves as a continuous audit trail.
- In `--fresh` mode, the workspace is rebuilt from scratch each round, so
  local `history/` directories do NOT persist automatically. Treat each
  round as an isolated evolution pass unless the current workspace already
  contains history files.

---

## Editing Principles

### Conservative Editing (for improve_skill)
- Treat the CURRENT skill as the **source of truth**, not a rough draft.
- Default to **targeted edits**, not rewrites.
- Preserve the original structure, heading order, and terminology.
- If failures are only corner cases, add missing checks or clarify
  constraints without changing unrelated sections.
- Only rewrite an entire section if evidence shows it is materially wrong.
- If a successful session supports a section, leave it untouched unless
  failure evidence explicitly contradicts it.

### Hard Constraints
- Do NOT change API contracts, ports, endpoints, output paths, payload
  formats, or required filenames — unless session evidence clearly shows
  they have changed.
- Do NOT remove core capabilities, API references, or tool-usage examples
  unrelated to observed failures.
- Do NOT turn a skill into a different skill with a different purpose.
- Do NOT rewrite the whole skill from scratch.
- Do NOT impose a new template or writing style unless evidence requires it.
- Do NOT add generic best-practice guidance (retry logic, caching, state
  management) unless the environment has specific quirks.

### Distinguishing Skill vs Agent Problems
Not every failure is a skill deficiency:
- **Skill problem** (wrong/missing guidance) → edit the skill.
- **Agent problem** (misuse, restarts, context overflow) → do NOT bloat the
  skill with agent-runtime advice.
- **Environment problem** (API instability, network flakiness) → add a brief
  note if recurrent, but keep it short.

Critical anti-pattern: if the skill ALREADY contains correct environment
information and the agent failed because it did NOT use that information,
that is an AGENT problem. Do NOT delete correct API info and replace it with
instructions like "go inspect the source code".

## Skill Writing Principles (for create_skill)
- A skill should compress **environment information** (API endpoints, ports,
  payload formats, tool quirks, domain procedures) — not generic best
  practices the agent already knows.
- Prefer a short, action-oriented name (lowercase-hyphenated slug).
- The name MUST differ from all existing skills. Check `manifest.json` for
  the current list of skill names before creating a new one.
- Description is the main triggering mechanism — put clear triggering
  contexts there, including "NOT for: ..." exclusion conditions.
- Content should be domain-specific, practically useful, and non-obvious.
- Use imperative instructions. Organize the body naturally for the task.
- Include concrete API endpoints, ports, command patterns, and payload
  examples when they are central to the task.
- Keep it concise, reusable, and evidence-driven.
- Write reusable guidance, not a failure summary or postmortem.

## Important Notes

- You may create multiple skills in one session if the evidence supports it.
- Process ALL sessions — don't stop after the first group.
- Write your changes directly to files in `skills/`. The server will detect
  what changed by comparing file hashes.
- ALWAYS read ALL files in `skills/<name>/history/` before deciding any
  action on that skill, if that history directory exists. This is
  mandatory, not optional.
- ALWAYS save the old version and evidence before making changes.
- ALWAYS complete center harness self-validation before finalizing a changed
  skill, and record the result in the paired `history/v<N>_evidence.md` file.
- ALWAYS use version-based history filenames (`v<N>.md`,
  `v<N>_evidence.md`); never use date-based filenames.
- Do NOT modify files in `sessions/` — they are read-only input.
- Do NOT modify `manifest.json` or `skill_registry.json` — the server
  manages those.
- Do NOT access files outside this workspace directory.
- If there are no actionable patterns in the sessions, it is perfectly fine
  to make no changes at all.
