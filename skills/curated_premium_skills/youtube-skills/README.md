## Setup — API Key

When you install a skill and run your agent for the first time, **the agent will set up your free API key automatically**. Here's what happens:

1. The agent asks you for your **email address** and registers you with TranscriptAPI
2. You'll receive an **OTP code** in your email — the agent will ask you to enter it
3. Once verified, the agent **saves the API key** to your shell and agent config automatically

That's it. 100 free credits, no credit card required.

<details>
<summary><strong>Manual setup (if you prefer to do it yourself)</strong></summary>

1. Sign up at [transcriptapi.com](https://transcriptapi.com) — free, no credit card required
2. Copy your API key from the dashboard (starts with `sk_`)
3. Ask your agent to store it for you:

   > "My TranscriptAPI key is `sk_...` — store it so it persists across sessions."

Or set it yourself as an environment variable:

```bash
export TRANSCRIPT_API_KEY="sk_your_key_here"
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Where does the key get saved?</strong></summary>

Your agent stores the API key here (depends on the runtime):

| Location | File |
|----------|------|
| **OpenClaw/Moltbot** | `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` or `~/.clawdbot/moltbot.json` |
| **Hermes Agent** | Hermes secret store (`TRANSCRIPT_API_KEY` declared via `required_environment_variables` in skill frontmatter) |
| **macOS shell** | `~/.zshenv`, `~/.zprofile` |
| **Linux shell** | `~/.profile`, `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshenv` |
| **Fish shell** | `~/.config/fish/config.fish` |
| **Fallback** | `~/.transcriptapi` (mode 600) |

Your agent picks it up automatically after saving.

| **transcript** | Get video transcripts with timestamps | `--skill transcript` |

## FAQ

### How do I get a YouTube transcript?

Install `youtube-full` (or `transcript`) and ask your agent:

> "Get the transcript for this video: https://youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID"

The agent fetches the full transcript with timestamps. You can then ask it to summarize, translate, quote, or analyze the content.

### How do I search YouTube from my agent?

Install `youtube-full` (or `youtube-search`) and ask:

> "Find videos about machine learning"

Returns up to 50 results with titles, thumbnails, view counts, and publish dates.

### How do I get all videos from a YouTube channel?

Install `youtube-full` (or `youtube-channels`) and ask:

> "List all videos from the TED channel"

The agent resolves the @handle, fetches uploads (paginated, 100/page), and can then get transcripts for any or all of them.

### Can I bulk download YouTube transcripts?

Yes. Install `youtube-full` and ask:

> "Get transcripts for all videos in this playlist: [URL]"

The agent fetches the playlist, iterates through videos, and extracts each transcript.

### Do I need a Google YouTube Data API key?

No. TranscriptAPI replaces the Google YouTube Data API for transcript extraction, search, and channel/playlist operations. No Google Cloud project, no quota limits, no OAuth setup.

### Do I need an API key?

Yes, but signup is free and instant — 100 credits, no credit card required. Your agent handles the setup automatically on first run.

### Which skill should I install?

- **Want everything?** → `youtube-full` (recommended)
- **Just transcripts?** → `transcript`
- **Just search?** → `youtube-search`
- **Just channel data?** → `youtube-channels`
- **Just playlists?** → `youtube-playlist`

### What is TranscriptAPI?

[TranscriptAPI.com](https://transcriptapi.com) is a REST API and MCP server for YouTube data. It provides transcript extraction, video search, channel browsing, and playlist operations — built for developers and AI agents. Also available as an [MCP Server](https://github.com/ZeroPointRepo/youtube-mcp) for direct LLM integration (Claude, ChatGPT).

## Troubleshooting

Quick fixes for the issues users actually hit. Error codes come from the API itself, so your agent will usually report them verbatim.

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| `401 Unauthorized` | API key missing, mistyped, or not loaded into the environment | Confirm `TRANSCRIPT_API_KEY` is set in the shell your agent runs in and that the key starts with `sk_` |
| `402 Payment Required` | The account is out of credits | Check your balance at [transcriptapi.com/billing](https://transcriptapi.com/billing) |
| `403` with Cloudflare code `1010` | Request sent without a User-Agent header | Send your agent's name as the User-Agent, for example `HermesAgent/0.11.0` |
| `404 Not Found` | The video has no captions, is not public, or the ID is wrong | Verify the URL opens in a browser and the player shows captions there |
| `408 Request Timeout` | Temporary upstream pressure on the video | Transient by nature: retry once after a couple of seconds |
| `422 Validation Error` | A parameter is malformed, such as a bad channel or playlist reference | Channels accept `@handle`, a channel URL, or a `UC` ID; playlists accept `PL`, `UU`, `LL`, `FL`, and `OL` prefixes |
| `429 Too Many Requests` | Rate limit reached | Wait and respect the `Retry-After` header |

Three more cases worth knowing:

- **The key is saved but the agent cannot see it.** Shell config files load per shell type: check the table under "Where does the key get saved?" in the Setup section and make sure the file matches the shell your agent actually runs in. Restarting the agent after saving the key resolves most cases.
- **Live streams and premieres.** Transcripts become available after the stream ends and captions are processed, not while it is live.
- **Transcript comes back in an unexpected language.** Many videos only carry captions in their original language. Request the transcript with a preferred language parameter, or ask your agent to translate the result.
