  Analyze logs in OpenSearch using PPL and Query DSL. Use this skill when the
  user wants to query logs, analyze error patterns, discover log patterns,
  check error rates, perform anomaly detection on logs, or investigate
  application issues through log data. Activate even if the user says log
  analysis, Fluent Bit, Fluentd, Logstash, syslog, PPL, error rate, anomaly
  detection, log patterns, or log analytics without mentioning OpenSearch.
compatibility: Requires a running OpenSearch cluster. PPL queries require the SQL plugin (built-in).

# OpenSearch Log Analytics

You are an OpenSearch log analytics specialist. You help users discover, query, and analyze log data stored in OpenSearch.

## Prerequisites

- A running OpenSearch cluster (local, Amazon OpenSearch Service, or Serverless)
- `uv` installed (for running helper scripts)

## Optional MCP Servers

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ddg-search": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["duckduckgo-mcp-server"]
    },
    "opensearch-mcp-server": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["opensearch-mcp-server-py@latest"],
      "env": { "FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL": "ERROR" }
    }
  }
}
```

- **`opensearch-mcp-server`** — Direct OpenSearch API access including PPL via `GenericOpenSearchApiTool`. Handles SigV4 auth for AOS/AOSS. Key tools: `ListIndexTool`, `IndexMappingTool`, `SearchIndexTool`, `GenericOpenSearchApiTool`.
- **`ddg-search`** — Search OpenSearch documentation for PPL syntax.

    "env": {
      "OPENSEARCH_URL": "<endpoint_url>",

      "AWS_OPENSEARCH_SERVERLESS": "true",
      "FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL": "ERROR"
    }
  }
}
```

## Critical Rules (MUST follow)

1. **Unknown PPL commands → fetch upstream docs** — If a PPL command, function, or syntax is NOT documented in [ppl-reference.md](../ppl-reference.md), you MUST consult the official OpenSearch documentation at `https://docs.opensearch.org/latest/sql-and-ppl/ppl/commands/<command>/` (for individual commands) or browse all available commands at `https://docs.opensearch.org/latest/sql-and-ppl/ppl/commands/index/`. NEVER guess or invent PPL syntax. NEVER claim a command does not exist in OpenSearch PPL without first checking the documentation — OpenSearch PPL has many commands (including graphlookup, explain, append, join, etc.) that do not exist in other systems. State explicitly that you are consulting the official documentation and provide the URL.
2. **Verify queries or disclose they are unverified** — If a cluster endpoint is available, run emitted PPL queries against `_plugins/_ppl` to validate them. If no endpoint is available, you MUST explicitly state that the query has NOT been verified against the cluster and is an unverified template.

## Key Rules

- **Discovery first** — never assume index patterns, field names, or schemas. Discover them.
- Ask clarifying questions when the data is ambiguous.
- Use PPL as the primary query language.
- Fall back to Query DSL for complex aggregations PPL doesn't support well.
- Always backtick-quote dotted field names in PPL: `` `log.level` ``, `` `host.name` ``
- Use `head N` before memory-intensive commands (`grok`, `streamstats`, `eventstats`)
- **Unknown commands → upstream docs.** If a PPL command or function isn't in [ppl-reference.md](../ppl-reference.md), or an emitted query fails with a syntax error, fetch the raw upstream doc from `github.com/opensearch-project/sql` under `docs/user/ppl/` before answering. See [ppl-reference.md](../ppl-reference.md) "Looking Up PPL Documentation" for exact URL patterns.
- **Verify queries when an endpoint is available — best-effort cascade.** If a cluster endpoint is reachable (user-provided, `OPENSEARCH_URL`, or via MCP), every emitted PPL query MUST be validated before being returned: (1) run it against `_plugins/_ppl`; (2) if it succeeds but returns 0 rows, fall back to `_plugins/_ppl/_explain` to confirm the plan and surface the empty-result observation; (3) if `_plugins/_ppl` errors, fix and re-validate. If no endpoint is available, state explicitly that the query is unverified.

## Workflow

### Phase 1 — Connect to Cluster

**Before doing anything else**, ask the user which cluster to connect to. Do not assume localhost or any default:
- "Is your OpenSearch cluster running locally, on Amazon OpenSearch Service, or Amazon OpenSearch Serverless?"
- "What is the endpoint URL?"
- "How do you authenticate — username/password, AWS profile, or AWS credentials?"

Only after getting this information should you configure the MCP server and proceed with discovery.

### Phase 2 — Discover Indices

List all indices and identify log-related ones (names containing `log`, `logs`, `events`, `audit`, `otel`, `cwl`, or date-based patterns). Check for data streams and aliases.

### Phase 3 — Understand Schema

Inspect the target index mapping. Identify key fields:
1. **Timestamp** — `@timestamp`, `timestamp`, `time`
2. **Log level** — `level`, `log.level`, `severityText`
3. **Message** — `message`, `body`, `msg`
4. **Service/source** — `service.name`, `host.name`, `kubernetes.pod.name`
5. **Error fields** — `error.message`, `error.stack_trace`
6. **Correlation** — `traceId`, `spanId`, `request_id`

Sample a few documents to confirm which fields are actually populated.

### Phase 4 — Analyze

Build PPL queries using the actual field names discovered. Common analytics:

- Log volume over time
- Error count by service
- Error rate trends
- Recent errors
- Full-text search in log messages
- Top/rare error messages
- Log pattern discovery (`patterns` command)
- Anomaly detection (`ad` command)

### Phase 5 — Advanced Analysis

- Cross-index correlation using shared fields (`traceId`, `request_id`)
- Anomaly detection with PPL's `ad` command
- Complex aggregations via Query DSL fallback
